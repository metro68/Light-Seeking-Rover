# Light-Seeking-Rover

This is an A* Exemplar Extended Project Qualification work of Engineering.

The video of its most basic working ability is titled 'Video of deciding between two light sources'

The files titled, 'Aerial View', 'Left End View', 'Front View', 'Rear View' and 'Right End View' are all images of the rover. Download these to view them better as Discord isn't so good for viewing.

I used Arduino (C++) to program a rover to seek out the brightest source of light in its environment and move towards it while avoiding obstacles in its path.

I worked on this individually and it gave me a chance to learn the Arduino programming langauge which is an adaptation of the C++ Language.

I also got the chance to understand the working principles behind various electronic components such as the HC-SR04 sensor and Arduino UNO Microcontroller. 

It is typically designed for a photocell and ultrasonic sensor in the forward facing direction. 

An LED is used to indicate when the rover encounters an obstacle and the brakes are applied. The robot then scans for the next free path in its vicinity.

Modifications can be made to suit various needs.



Enjoy!!!!!!
